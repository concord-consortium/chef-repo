= DESCRIPTION:

Actually this cookbook should probably just be called "CC-CENTOS VMRUBY1.9.1 HACKS"
It attempts to undo some over-provisioning in the base image. Mostly it uninstalls packages
or moves them out of the way. (old git, old ruby ...)

TODO: Ruby 1.9.2 gems are being installed in a directory named 1.9.1 (!)
